CAD-Comic downloader
=====

This is a small tool that will download the CAD-comics from a certain year (or, alternatively, all comics starting from 2002).

My main motivation for writing this was to play around with Python a bit. I do encourage you to support Tim (the author of CAD-comic) on patreon if you like the comics. Downloading them to your hard drive - whilst handy to read when not connected to the internet - does prevent Tim from earning revenue through cad-comic.
